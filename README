Mastermind, or "Break the code" is a two-player game. One player makes a code
consists of 4 different digits (from 1 through 8) in a random order, and the 
second has 9 tries to guess what the code is. In order to do this, after each 
guess, the 'coder' imforms the 'code-breaker' how many of his digits are correct
and how many are it the right place too.

Installation Instructions:

To install, just cd to the directory where you downloaded the code and type
'make'. This will also install the files, so once you do this you are ready to
go!!!
